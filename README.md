The experiment ran on the server with:
### CPU information:  56  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2660 v4 @ 2.00GHz
### memory info: 	  256GB

## Suggestion: Please run the routine on server which has similar hardware in order to reproduce it. Please do not run it on personal computer since it will be out of memory error. Because the CPU and memory are not enough to run large dataset experiment.

### Test is written in model_code.
